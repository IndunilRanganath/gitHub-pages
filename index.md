<h6>GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration that is widely used by software developers and other individuals or teams who work on code-based projects. It was launched in 2008 and has since become one of the most popular code-hosting platforms in the world.

At its core, GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, which means that it provides a way for developers to store and manage their source code and project files. However, GitHub also offers a range of features that make it much more than just a code repository. For example, it allows developers to track changes to their code over time, collaborate with others on projects, and even host static websites and web applications.

GitHub is built on a social networking model, so users can follow other developers and projects, leave comments and feedback on code, and participate in discussions and issue tracking. This makes it a powerful platform for building and sharing open source software, as well as for collaborating on closed-source projects within an organization.
GitHub has become an essential tool for developers, providing a way to manage code and collaborate on projects with others, as well as a platform for sharing and discovering new code and ideas.
